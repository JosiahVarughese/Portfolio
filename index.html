                <p>
                    I've always had a fixation with understanding how things work.<br>
                    I started exploring my own ideas by means of concept art at a very early age, this led to 3D modeling, animation and then video game design.<br>
                    I quickly became obsessed with the intricacies of math and logic and their connection to human psychology and the world around me.
